4. Extract it
5. Run 'GaanaDownloader_Reg_Install.bat' from extracted folder. **It adds an entry into Registry to enable the Extension and the Utility to 'speak'**
6. Run GaanaDownloader.bat and choose option to Listen for Chrome Extension
7. In Chrome go to gaana.com and you should be able to see checkbox near albums and tracks
8. Select the ones you want to download
9. Click on the 'G' icon in the extension toolbar
10. A pop-up with the album/songs selected should get displayed
11. Click on 'Download' and wait for the message that it has been triggered
12. Navigate to the batch file that was running
13. It should be processing the results and after processing it should ask for download quality
